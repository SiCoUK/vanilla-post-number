# Vanilla Forum Post Number Plugin
A Vanilla Plugin to show the post number alongside each post, originally written by HBF and modified by SiCo.

## Version 1.0

This version adds the Permalink of the comment to the post number as a link. The post number has been modified to show as "#2" etc. instead of "Post 2 of 3" to match the PunBB style. I will possibly make this a setting at some point.
